4/25/2019 17:21,CS,Prototype A video,1 - Not urgent,3,5,2,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,2,4 - Neutral,6,5,3,6,4,Speed,Most distracted by speed,Blue color not much noticeable.
4/25/2019 17:30,WA,Prototype B video,6,3,5,5,4 - Neutral,3,3,7 - Most urgent,2,6,4 - Neutral,4 - Neutral,3,Shape,Triangle shape seems to be more urgent than the curved shape,Every color had curve and triangle shapes which didn't imply much about the urgency.

No matter what the speed of the notification was, color was the only thing that grabbed my attention.",I wasn't able to distinguish between the different shapes while engrossed in a task.
4/25/2019 17:44,VS,Prototype B video,5,4 - Neutral,6,5,5,3,5,7 - Most urgent,1 - Not urgent,6,4 - Neutral,5,4,Speed,"Shapes are not that identifiable in the periphery, speed was the only thing that seemed to make difference to urgency levels.",I liked that you tried different things to notify different urgency levels.
4/25/2019 17:52,SA,Prototype A video,6,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,2,7 - Most urgent,5,2,5,5,6,1 - Not urgent,3,4,Color,Blue is my favorite color so it was the first noticeable feature. And fast red shows urgency,"The notification contained the mixture of color, speed, and shape."
4/25/2019 20:10,BDB,Prototype A video,5,5,6,4 - Neutral,5,3,4 - Neutral,5,4 - Neutral,5,3,5,3,Color,I subconsciously associated red with being more urgent.,I liked the fact that the motion in the periphery did not completely interfere with my task at hand.
4/25/2019 20:17,BD,Prototype B video,3,3,4 - Neutral,4 - Neutral,5,3,5,5,3,6,3,5,3,Speed,The easiest thing to distinguish between all the notifications was speed and then color.,It wasn't a hindrance to what I was doing.
4/28/2019 21:37,MK,Prototype A video,3,2,6,5,6,7 - Most urgent,1 - Not urgent,6,3,5,1 - Not urgent,2,4,Speed,Red color with high speed grabbed the most attention. But speed was the noticeable feature,Notifications were very vibrant compared to brightness of reading article through the lens.
4/28/2019 21:43,SA,Prototype B video,3,4 - Neutral,6,3,2,1 - Not urgent,5,4 - Neutral,1 - Not urgent,6,3,4 - Neutral,4,Speed,Speed of notifications grabbed their attention easily.,Good prototype. Has some nice real world usability.
4/28/2019 22:57,KB,Prototype A video,3,6,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,5,4 - Neutral,5,6,5,4 - Neutral,5,4,Color,Change in color was the most attention grabbing thing while reading the article.,"The device is effective in getting attention from reading text , with it's different colors."
4/28/2019 23:13,BY,Prototype B video,7 - Most urgent,6,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,6,6,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,6,7 - Most urgent,5,5,3,Speed,No extra comments.,"While  testing if the notifications would have been on both the sides in random manner, then it would be more effective to answer, as in this they were expecting that a notification would be coming on the right. Shapes weren't that noticeable since the notifications were running vertically continuously."
4/28/2019 23:39,CM,Prototype B video,6,4 - Neutral,5,3,5,3,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,3,5,4 - Neutral,6,4,Speed,Shape requires more focus. Easy to detect sudden movement or change in speed.,Slow moving notifications were more distracting in a bad way.
4/29/2019 16:02,TA,Prototype A video,2,1 - Not urgent,3,1 - Not urgent,4 - Neutral,3,1 - Not urgent,2,1 - Not urgent,3,1 - Not urgent,2,4,Speed,Was relatively difficult to discern between yellow and orange. Shape was more or less not visible at all unless I specifically tried to be on the lookout for a notification. Which is why I'd say that speed was the easiest to notice.,I liked that the notification did not take up the complete screen and that I can broadly guess what the notification means based on their color and speed. Shapes were largely unnoticeable. 
4/29/2019 16:24,SU,Prototype A video,6,4 - Neutral,5,2,4 - Neutral,5,2,5,1 - Not urgent,5,1 - Not urgent,2,4,Speed,Because that's how I thought that the notification is urgent,I liked the speed
4/29/2019 16:30,SS,Prototype B video,2,2,6,2,6,1 - Not urgent,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,2,5,3,7 - Most urgent,3,Speed,it is easier to recognize the movement than shape or color,I liked the use of different colors for different type of notifications
4/29/2019 17:16,NM,Prototype A video,4 - Neutral,3,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,5,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,3,4 - Neutral,4,Color,Red is more striking and disturbing than other colors. I haven't noticed shape of  the notification.,I disliked red color as it is disturbing.
4/29/2019 17:20,SH,Prototype B video,1 - Not urgent,4 - Neutral,3,2,6,6,3,7 - Most urgent,7 - Most urgent,1 - Not urgent,7 - Most urgent,5,3,Speed,I have observed that few notifications were very fast and wavering when compared to others.,The combination of color and speed was good to identify different notifications.
4/29/2019 19:41,LS,Prototype A video,2,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,2,7 - Most urgent,5,2,2,7 - Most urgent,5,5,7 - Most urgent,4,Color,it is more noticeable. ,I liked it as I don't have to change my focus.

4/29/2019 20:22,KC,Prototype A video,6,5,7 - Most urgent,2,7 - Most urgent,6,1 - Not urgent,5,3,5,2,1 - Not urgent,4,Color,"When I am working on a focused task, I find that the most noticeable feature is color, I can easily distinguish the color from a single frame. When it comes to speed, I can only tell if it is slow or fast. The shape is not a factor","I like the non invasive way of notifying the user. The video also has an aesthetic appeal that does not distract me from the task.
I would have liked to see some sound notifications as well. "
4/29/2019 20:30,BS,Prototype A video,5,3,7 - Most urgent,5,7 - Most urgent,5,3,5,3,4 - Neutral,2,5,4,Color,It is more noticeable when compared to speed and shape. Speed is the second dimension which was prominent after color.,The effort put in to show notifications. Mapping different colors and speed would be a major challenge.
4/29/2019 20:48,AP,Prototype B video,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,5,4 - Neutral,2,7 - Most urgent,4 - Neutral,7 - Most urgent,2,3,4,Color,All the shapes were almost similar. Color is the only thing that is too obvious to observe when you are working on something else.,The screen infront is not so clear.
